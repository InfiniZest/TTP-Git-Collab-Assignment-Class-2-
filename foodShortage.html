        <h3 class = "intro">As NYC continues to grapple the situation resulting from the COVID-19 and economic shutdown, a new crisis became apparent, food shortages. With 
            the shutdown of the economy and New Yorkers losing their jobs, many families have difficulty putting food on the table and meeting ends meet. According to the food
            bank, nearly three-quarters of the food pantries and soup kitchens have reported in overall visitors compared to before covid.

        <h3 class="fact1">Food Bank has distributed nearly 21 million meals across the city since the start of the outbreak, an increase of 20 percent in overall food distribution compared 
            to the same period last year</h3>
