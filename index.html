            <p class="content">We’ve reached 2021, great. 2020 has been a tough time for us all and as New Yorkers we have to do our best to continue 
            giving back to our community. We’re nearing the end of the battle with COVID but there is still much to do to help reconstruct 
            our crippled communities. The purpose of this site is to help list some of the major sites that are supporting our communities in need. 
            In particular we are looking for your support in giving back to our food banks and local pantries across the city.</p>

            <p class="content">According to NY1’s citywide study, Laura Aclan who is the program coordinator for the Christian Pentecostal Church on 
            Staten Island, she has been serving food to more than 1,000 people a week throughout different food pantries in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens. 
            At the moment she has been noticing that there has been a spike in the demands of food for those people wanting more food and other miscellaneous 
            groceries during this pandemic. This demand has not been seen for a while ever since Sandy, and this isn’t stopping with Feeding America stating 
            that the amount of demand is expected to go up as high as 19 percent now and may continue to grow even higher in the coming months. This is why we 
            need your help. This value will only continue to grow if we don’t give back. We are all suffering but whatever you can give can mean a lot of someone 
            who is making a smaller income.</p>
